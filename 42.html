		<p>Information about CSS</p>
		<div>
		<p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation 
		of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.</p> 
		<p>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different 
		types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, 
		or printers.</p>
		<h3><p>CSS is independent of HTML</p> and can be used 
		with any XML-based markup language.</h3>
