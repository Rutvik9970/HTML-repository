		<h2>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different 
		types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, 
		or printers.</h2>
		<h3><p>CSS is independent of HTML</p> and can be used 
		with any XML-based markup language.</h3>

        but h1+h3 will not give expected o/p
	    And h1+h2 give the expected o/p
	    because h2 is the immidiate element after h1 -->
