        <h1>Agriculture Information</h1>
        <p>Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, 
            aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products. 
            Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human 
            civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food 
            surpluses that enabled people to live in cities.</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.india.gov.in/topics/agriculture">Agriculture, 
            with its allied sectors, is unquestionably the 
            largest livelihood provider in India, more so in the vast rural areas. 
            It also contributes a significant figure to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
            Sustainable agriculture, in terms of food security, rural employment, and 
            environmentally sustainable technologies such as soil conservation, 
            sustainable natural resource management and biodiversity protection, 
            are essential for holistic rural development.</blockquote>
