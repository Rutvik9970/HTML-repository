            <p>CSS is the language for describing the presentation 
            of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.</p> 
            <p>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different 
            types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, 
            or printers.</p>
            <h3>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used 
                with any XML-based markup language.
